"The origins of Austria date back to the time of the Roman Empire when a "
"Celtic kingdom was conquered by the Romans in approximately 15 BCE, and "
"later became Noricum, a Roman province, in the mid 1st century CE - an area "
"which mostly encloses today's Austria. In 788 CE, the Frankish king "
"Charlemagne conquered the area, and introduced Christianity. Under the "
"native Habsburg dynasty, Austria became one of the great powers of Europe. "
"In 1867, the Austrian Empire was reformed into Austria-Hungary. The Austro-"
"Hungarian Empire collapsed in 1918 with the end of World War I. After "
"establishing the First Austrian Republic in 1919, Austria joined Nazi "
"Germany in the Anschluss in 1938. This lasted until the end of World War II "
"in 1945, after which Austria was occupied by the Allies."
